<b>About the Company: </b>Our client is building a radically new data quality and data observability platform. The enterprise data stack is going through a massive data transformation as data creation continues to accelerate every year. This goes hand in hand with mission-critical dependence on data for product operation and business decision making. Ensuring high data quality for data driven products and businesses is a top priority for data teams. Yet data is often unreliable and unusable, because traditional tools and home grown strategies are coming up short.
